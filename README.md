This project aims to educate people about the potential of wood sponges in cleaning up oil spills. I wanted to make something interactive and informative, so I built this website with a mix of p5.js simulations, a 3D model, and detailed step-by-step info.

Features:
p5.js Simulation: Play with hydrophobic oil and water molecules to understand how they interact.
Wood Sponge Creation: Interactive stepper component to walk through the process of making wood sponges.
3D Model: Explore the wood spongeâ€™s structure in 3D.
YouTube Demo: Watch how wood sponges are used in oil spill cleanup.

Tech Stack:
Next.js (for SSR and routing)
Tailwind CSS (for responsive design)
TypeScript (for type safety)
p5.js (for simulations)
3D Modeling (to visualize the wood sponge)

What I Learned:
Tackling p5.js for the simulation was a huge learning curve but fun!
Created a 3D model of the wood sponge to better explain its structure.
Used Next.js and Tailwind to build a smooth, responsive site.
