I built this Wood Sponge Exploration inspired by a school project. I wanted to take my knowledge one step further by creating an informative, interactive website that educates students. I learned how to implement p5.js simulations (quite a learning curve), how to 3D model (time not tracked :/), youtube API, etc. It's built in Nextjs with Tailwind and Typescript!
